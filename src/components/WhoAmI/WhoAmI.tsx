    <div className='text'>I started programming with C++/Java in introduction courses at Montgomery College back in 2018. In 2022 I started learning web development on my own, I built applications using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python. I worked through The Odin Project's entire full-stack JavaScript boot camp while working full-time at an autobody shop. I am now set on contributing to the success of a professional development team. Through my time spent teaching myself to code, I have developed discipline, curiosity, and passion. It has been a wonderful experience, and I am excited to continue learning every day in a professional environment.
